.SYNOPSIS
    Resolve ledger paths to the round ledger files they name - the one file
    collection test-ledger.ps1 and get-rejected-points.ps1 share.

.DESCRIPTION
    Both scripts take files or folders. A folder yields its `*-ledger.jsonl`
    files, sorted by name; a file is taken as it is. Without -Path the
    repository's `docs/decisions/` is read. A path that exists nowhere throws,
    so a typo is not read as "no ledger, nothing found".

    This script is deliberately SELF-CONTAINED - it imports no module, because
    it is mirrored into every consumer via scripts/common/.

.PARAMETER Path
    Ledger files or folders holding them. Default: `docs/decisions/` of the
    repository this script sits in.

.INPUTS
    None.

.OUTPUTS
    [string] one full path per ledger file.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/common/get-ledger-file.ps1 -Path docs/decisions

    The round ledgers of the decision folder, by name.
