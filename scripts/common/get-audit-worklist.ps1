.SYNOPSIS
    Build the work list the state audit walks: status markers, open tracking
    issue points, and every TODO / HACK / FIXME with its carrier reference.

.DESCRIPTION
    .agents/rules/audit.md, section "State Audit", requires an audit before every new slice,
    and the `state-audit` skill runs it. Its first step is not judgement but
    collection - and collection done from memory leaves out exactly the source
    nobody holds in their head. This script does the collecting.

    Seven lists, each emitted with its own Source value so the audit can group
    them:

    * marker - every APPLIED marker statement in the repository's Markdown, with
      path and line. The marker WORDS are a table, not a hardcoded pattern -
      [erfuellt] / [teilweise] / [geplant] plus a fourth form
      [nicht verifiziert] ("weder aus dem Repo heraus zu belegen noch zu
      widerlegen", for a statement about a foreign repository this one only
      pins a dependency on) - so a repository that adopts a new applied form
      costs a row in that table, never a new pattern written against this
      script (ww3d/playbook#215, ww3d/playbook#216). Backticks around the marker do not change whether it
      raises a raw hit; whether it is an INSTANCE or a QUOTATION of the
      convention is decided separately and for EACH OCCURRENCE: a real CODE
      BLOCK (fenced or indented) always means quotation, decided on the Markdown
      syntax tree rather than a heuristic; a longer inline code span around the
      marker, an enumeration (a separator-joined chain of markers holding more
      than one distinct marker), or a file whose whole purpose is to define the grammar mean
      the same. Several applied markers on one line are several entries. These
      are target-vs-actual displays, not carriers; the audit is what carries
      each one to a carrier. Each entry carries two more columns: Carrier, one
      of covered / not-a-carrier / carrier-closed / target-missing /
      unverifiable, decided from the optional reference in the brackets
      ([geplant #45], [geplant roadmap], [geplant backlog], [geplant
      owner/repo#45]); and Hash, eight hex characters of SHA-256 over the
      statement segment with the marker removed, so a changed statement shows
      as changed at the next audit. A [teilweise] naming no `fehlt:` in its
      reach carries the Note 'teilweise (undetermined)'.
    * remaining - every `fehlt:` in prose, with the text up to the next marker,
      `steht:`, or the end of its paragraph or list item, the nearest heading
      above it as Note, and the Hash of the statement it belongs to.
    * uncovered-carriers - open tracking issues and their open points that no
      marker reference names (not read under -SkipIssue). roadmap.md /
      backlog.md lines are not listed one by one.
    * tracking-issue - the body of every open tracking issue, one entry per
      unticked checklist line as get-checklist-items.ps1 reads it (in a quote
      yes, in a code fence no), PLUS every open GitHub Sub-Issue of that issue
      (Entscheidung 6, carrier.md, section "Tracking Issue": past a size guideline a
      tracking issue trades its checkboxes for Sub-Issues, and the body then
      carries only the current state - reading the body alone would miss them).
      Needs `gh` and reads over REST only, never GraphQL (ww3d/playbook#257), with the
      repository from -Repo or the checkout's remote; when `gh` is missing,
      unauthenticated, or the repository cannot be resolved the source is reported
      as unavailable rather than silently empty, because an empty source and a
      skipped source look identical in a report. A single issue's Sub-Issues
      call failing degrades separately and quietly (most issues have none at
      all, which is an empty answer, not an error) - it does not turn the whole
      source unavailable.
    * marker-comment - every TODO / HACK / FIXME in code or in prose, colon or
      not, with the
      FORM of the carrier reference it names: an issue reference, a URL, or a
      carrier file of the repository. One naming nothing is itself a finding
      (.agents/rules/carrier.md, section "Carrier Requirement").
    * backlog - every open point of backlog.md (root or docs/) with its age in
      audit stamps survived, for the aging step of the state audit (ww3d/playbook#265).
      Note is `aged: survived N audits` from three on, `ages: survived N
      audits` below, and `exempt: roadmap place` or `exempt: named trigger`
      where the point carries `*(Eingereiht ... roadmap.md ...)*` or
      `**Ausloeser:**` - those do not age. Struck-through points are
      delivered and left out; without git history, or in a shallow clone,
      the age is unknown and says so.
    * source-report - one entry per source above: how many raw hits it saw, how
      many it discarded and why; plus 'carrier' (markers with a reference, the
      count per Carrier value, the undetermined ones) and, where issues were
      read, 'uncovered-carriers' (how long that list is). A marker or marker-comment
      source that discarded EVERYTHING it saw ends the run as an error (exit 1), not as a quiet source-report line
      indistinguishable from "nothing there to find" - zero usable out of a
      non-zero raw count is a finding about the filter, not a quiet result.

    A file can declare its own quotations: a comment line of its own reading
    `audit-worklist: quoted` (after `<!--`, `#` or `//`) turns every marker,
    `fehlt:` and TODO below it into a discarded hit with the reason
    'declared quoted', up to the end of the file or an `audit-worklist: end`
    line. A state audit report carries it under its title, a fixture for its
    test data.

    This script is deliberately SELF-CONTAINED - it imports no module, because
    it is mirrored into every consumer via scripts/common/. It calls one
    sibling there, get-checklist-items.ps1, for the checkbox reading it shares
    with find-closable-issues.ps1.

    It only ever READS. Correcting a marker or editing an issue body is the
    audit's job, not this script's.

.PARAMETER Path
    Repository root to scan. Defaults to the repository this script sits in.

.PARAMETER Repo
    owner/name of the repository whose open tracking issues are read, and
    against which a `#N` reference is checked. Defaults to what `gh` resolves
    from the git remote of the scanned checkout.

.PARAMETER Label
    Issue label that marks a tracking issue. Default 'tracking'.

.PARAMETER SkipIssue
    Collect the local sources only and do not call `gh` at all; an issue
    reference in a marker is then unverifiable.

.PARAMETER Json
    Serialize the work list as JSON instead of emitting objects.

.PARAMETER Sarif
    Emit the marker, marker-comment and remaining findings as a SARIF 2.1.0 log
    instead of the default objects/JSON, Carrier and Hash in each result's
    properties and the uncovered carriers in the run's properties.
    tracking-issue and source-report entries carry no repository location and
    are left out. -Sarif takes precedence over -Json when both are given.

.INPUTS
    None.

.OUTPUTS
    [pscustomobject] per entry with Source, Path, Line, Text, Note, Carrier,
    Hash and Reference - the last three empty where they do not apply.
    Reference is the carrier reference inside a marker's own brackets, as
    written (`#N`, `owner/repo#N`, `roadmap`, `backlog`); Text is the whole
    line, which may carry other markers and mentions.

# raw count in the first place.
#
# The optional carrier reference inside the brackets (docs.md, section "Target
# vs. Actual"; Entscheidung 9 of ww3d/playbook#258) is part of the same hit: `[geplant #45]`,
# `[geplant roadmap]`, `[geplant backlog]`, and `[geplant owner/repo#45]` for an
# issue in a foreign repo. A marker with a reference is still one raw hit.

# The pattern above is nakedly permissive on purpose - it is the RAW count. What
# separates an applied marker from a quoted one is not the pattern but the
# position and the line: a marker inside a CODE BLOCK is MARKUP naming the
# convention, not an instance of it. In the first real run - a consumer's
# state audit - 36 of 36 hits were of that kind, so the source
# produced nothing usable and looked like it had worked.
#
# The position comes from the Markdown syntax tree, not from a heuristic: a
# parser knows the difference by construction, while a hand-rolled guard has to
# rebuild it and is wrong again with every new writing style. That is how prose
# linters do it - Vale reads at tree level and excludes code by default.
#
# MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT, because Markdig sets precise source positions
# only on a pipeline configured for them and the built-in cmdlet's pipeline was
# unverified: ConvertFrom-Markdown does report Line and Span for inline nodes,
# and slicing the source with a reported Span returns exactly the node's text.
# Both halves of this filter therefore read the tree; there is no line-wise
# fallback because there is nothing to fall back from.
#
# CodeInline is deliberately NOT in this set (ww3d/playbook#215): an inline code span no
# longer disqualifies a marker by itself - a backtick-wrapped `[erfuellt]`
# standing on its own is the APPLIED form in at least two consumer repos. Only
# a real CODE BLOCK (fenced or indented) still means "this is a worked example
# of the syntax, not a statement about this repository".

# walk above no longer makes that distinction at all now that CodeInline is
# out of it.

# The other half of the classification: an OCCURRENCE naming the convention
# rather than applying it (Entscheidung 6 of ww3d/playbook#258 - decided per hit, never per
# line: some consumers write a main marker plus a second one for a
# partial promise on the same line, and a line rule dropped 16 and 41 applied
# markers there, ww3d/playbook#254 / ww3d/playbook#255). Three shapes, none needing a Markdown parse:
#   * the hit is part of a LONGER inline code span (below, per hit);
#   * the hit is one link of an ENUMERATION - two different marker words with
#     nothing but separators between them ("traegt `[erfuellt]`, `[teilweise]`
#     oder `[geplant]`"). A statement needs words between two states; a list
#     of the grammar has none. Controller decision of 17.09.2026 on ww3d/playbook#258, so
#     a consumer's preamble stays a quotation while its applied lines count;
#   * the hit stands in one of a small set of files whose entire purpose IS to
#     define these markers. Listed here by path for the same reason the marker
#     words are a table above: a rule text that moves gets one row updated
#     here, not a special case in the walker.

# The same exception for the marker-comment source: a file whose purpose is to
# define what a TODO / HACK / FIXME marker is. This script names the words in
# its help, its comments and its own two patterns - since the colon became

# in every consumer the script is mirrored into (review of ww3d/playbook#260).

# A marker is `TODO`, `HACK` or `FIXME`, optionally with a parenthesised
# reference (`TODO(#42)`) and optionally with a colon. The colon USED to be
# required; carrier.md, section "Carrier Requirement", requires none, and
# a consumer once wrote its one real marker as "`IsFork`-Gate = TODO", which the
# colon filter dropped with every other hit of that repo (ww3d/playbook#256, Entscheidung 7
# of ww3d/playbook#258: the script follows the rule, the rule does not grow a colon). The
# price is paid knowingly: a sentence that names the words in uppercase and
# without backticks now counts too, and the audit reads it as such.
# What stays strict:
#   * UPPERCASE only, matched with -cmatch. PowerShell's -match is
#     case-INSENSITIVE, so a plain `\b(TODO|HACK|FIXME)\b` also catches the
#     lowercase `todo` inside the Conventional-Comments vocabulary next door in
#     measure-review-comment.ps1.
#   * \b at the front so `NOTODO` is not a marker.
#   * A leading backtick disqualifies the match: inside `TODO` the word is
#     MARKUP quoting a marker, not one. That is what this very comment does, and
#     what a rule text does when it names the convention it defines.

# upstream repo writes its reference as a URL.
#
# Which of the forms are reported is what changed with them: GitHub itself
# treats several spellings as the same reference and which ones count depends on

# The backlog source (ww3d/playbook#265): every open point of backlog.md, with how many
# audits it has survived. The aging rule of the state-audit skill hoists a
# line that survived three audit stamps into the next slice's tracking issue -
# and without an exception it hoisted, at every slice again, lines that wait on
# purpose. Two forms exempt a point, both
# literal and case-sensitive so the exemption stays mechanical rather than a
# judgement call (carrier.md, section "Tracking Issue"): the roadmap-place note
# `*(Eingereiht ... roadmap.md ...)*`, and the bold label `**Ausloeser:**`
# naming the trigger that makes the point due.
#
# A point is a list item at the left margin with its continuation lines, up to
# a blank line, a heading or the next such item; a struck-through one (`~~`
# right after the list marker) is delivered and left out. A code fence is no
# point.
#
# Its age is counted in audit stamps, not days: the stamps in the file names of
# audit/ist-stand-*.md later than the newest commit time of the point's lines -
# the newest, so an edited point starts over, which is the same thing a new
# point does. Read with `git blame`; without history, or where a line's commit
# sits at the cut of a shallow clone, the age is unknown and the Note says so
# rather than guessing. A legacy stamp without `Z` (the rule
# was local time until ww3d/playbook#208) is read as UTC - off by one or two hours, which
# decides nothing at the granularity of audits days apart.
# From `*(Eingereiht` up to the closing `)*`, with `roadmap.md` anywhere in
# between - the note carries a Markdown link, whose own `)` must not end it.
