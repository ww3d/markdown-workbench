.SYNOPSIS
    Hold every carrier line a pull request adds against the files that same
    pull request creates or changes, and report each hit as a moved fix.

.DESCRIPTION
    .agents/rules/carrier.md, section "Carrier Requirement": a gap in a file
    the PR itself creates or changes, with a known fix, is fixed in the PR. A
    line written for it into the tracking issue's body, into roadmap.md or into
    backlog.md is no carrier but a moved fix, and .agents/rules/review.md,
    section "Review Comments", makes it an `issue: (blocking)` at every one of
    those carriers. This script is the mechanical half of the check, so the
    reviewer does not have to see it.

    The new carrier lines, from two sources:

    * file - every line the PR adds to roadmap.md or backlog.md (in the
      repository root or under docs/), taken from the PR's own diff.
    * tracking-issue - every line that is new in the body of a tracking issue
      since the work on the PR began. The start is the earlier of the PR's
      creation and the author date of its first commit: review waves run
      before the PR is opened, and so does the deferral they cause. The body
      as it stood then comes from the issue's edit history - which GitHub
      exposes over GraphQL only (userContentEdits). Where GraphQL is blocked
      (a Claude Code session, ww3d/playbook#257) that source is reported as unavailable,
      never as empty.

    Lines are grouped into points: a list item, or a paragraph. A point that
    is struck through (`~~`) or a ticked checkbox is a delivered one and is
    left out; a line inside a code fence is no point.

    A point hits when one of its NEW lines names a file of the PR diff (added,
    modified, renamed or copied; the carrier files themselves are not
    targets): by its repository path, or by a trailing part of that path
    (`reference/checks.md`, `checks.md`) that no other file of the repository
    ends with. Uniqueness is read from `git ls-files` of the checkout under
    -Path plus the PR's own files; without git only the full path counts, and
    the source report says so. A point that names its file in no such form -
    by a class or function name, or in prose ("the parser test") - is not
    found: the script is the floor of the check, not all of it, and the
    reviewer's table "Verschobenes" (pr-poll-review) stays the net for it.

    One Result per hit:

    * moved-fix     - an `issue: (blocking)`, no judgement involved.
    * no-known-fix  - the point carries the fixed form `**Kein Fix bekannt:**`
                      followed by its reason. Not blocking by itself; the
                      reviewer checks the reason (pr-poll-review, table
                      "Verschobenes").

    Plus one `source-report` entry per source read (new lines, points, hits),
    and one `unavailable` entry per source that could not be read.

    This script is deliberately SELF-CONTAINED - it imports no module, because
    it is mirrored into every consumer via scripts/common/. Issues and pull
    requests are read over REST (`gh api repos/...`); the edit history is the
    one GraphQL call, and nothing else depends on it.

    It only ever READS. Exit 1 on any moved-fix and whenever a source is
    unavailable; 0 otherwise, no-known-fix included.

.PARAMETER Pr
    Number of the pull request to check.

.PARAMETER Repo
    owner/name of the repository. Defaults to what `gh` resolves from the git
    remote of the checkout under -Path.

.PARAMETER TrackingIssue
    Tracking issue number(s) whose body is checked. Defaults to every issue
    the PR body names as `#N` that carries -Label.

.PARAMETER Label
    Issue label that marks a tracking issue. Default 'tracking'.

.PARAMETER Path
    Repository checkout whose tracked files decide whether a short file name
    is unique. Defaults to the repository this script sits in.

.PARAMETER Json
    Serialize the entries as JSON instead of emitting objects.

.INPUTS
    None.

.OUTPUTS
    [pscustomobject] per entry with Result, Carrier, Line, File, Text and
    Origin. Carrier is the carrier path or `#N`; Line is 1-based in the file at
    the PR head, or in the issue body; File lists the PR files the point names.
    Origin, for a tracking-issue hit only, names the edit that wrote its new
    lines (`edited <time> by <login>`) or the opening of an issue younger than
    the work: the body keeps no author per line, so a point a parallel PR of
    the same design added shows up as well, and Origin tells the two apart.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/common/find-moved-fixes.ps1 -Repo ww3d/playbook -Pr 278

    Human-readable, one line per hit.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/common/find-moved-fixes.ps1 -Pr 278 -TrackingIssue 258 -Json

    Machine-readable, the tracking issue named explicitly.
