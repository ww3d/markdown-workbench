.SYNOPSIS
    After a green merge gate and the merge: close the tracking issue the pull
    request names - but only if it is closable.

.DESCRIPTION
    .agents/rules/carrier.md, section "Tracking Issue", has whoever merges
    close the tracking issue. This script does it in one step and keeps the
    closing rule out of the hands of memory: the issues are the ones named by
    `Refs #N` / `Closes #N` (and the other keywords of the PR description
    rule, at a line start) in the PR body; each one is judged by
    find-closable-issues.ps1 -Pr (no open checkbox, no Sub-Issue open, nothing
    in the repository that still names it as its carrier, no marker to
    re-hang first). A closable issue gets the closing comment that script
    wrote and is closed as completed. An issue that is not closable stays
    open and the output says why.

    No pull is needed first: when the merge commit is not in the HEAD of
    -Root, the script fetches it from origin and judges against a temporary
    detached worktree at it, removed afterwards; the checkout itself is not
    changed.

    Refuses to act (exit 1) when the PR is not merged, when the merge commit is
    neither in the HEAD of -Root nor fetchable from origin (the carrier search
    would read a tree from before the merge: NOT VERIFIED), when the repository
    cannot be searched (SOURCE UNAVAILABLE), or when a write fails. An issue
    that stays open for a reason is no error: exit 0. A PR body that names no
    issue of this repository closes nothing and says so.

    Supports -WhatIf / -Confirm: the judgement runs, the comment and the close
    do not.

.PARAMETER Repo
    owner/name of the repository.

.PARAMETER Pr
    Number of the merged pull request.

.PARAMETER Root
    A directory inside a checkout of the repository, which
    find-closable-issues.ps1 searches for carrier formulas. It may be behind
    the merge; its origin remote then supplies the merge commit. Defaults to
    the repository this script sits in.

.INPUTS
    None.

.OUTPUTS
    [string] one line per named issue: closed, would close, or stays open and why.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/common/close-tracking-issue.ps1 -Repo ww3d/playbook -Pr 352 -WhatIf
