.SYNOPSIS
    Report which open issues are closable: no open checkbox, no open
    Sub-Issue, and nothing in the repository that still names them as a
    carrier.

.DESCRIPTION
    .agents/rules/carrier.md, section "Tracking Issue", makes the reviewer of
    the PR that ticks off an issue's last point responsible for closing it -
    every issue with a checklist, label `tracking` or not - once both checks
    from section "Carrier Requirement" have run: no unticked checkbox, and
    nothing that names the issue as its carrier. This script runs both checks
    and hands over the list (Entscheidung 10 of #258). It never closes,
    comments on or edits anything: closing is a role action, not a side effect
    of a script.

    Two modes:

    * -Pr N - the issues PR N names: every `#N`, `owner/repo#N` and GitHub
      issue or pull request URL in the PR body and in the messages of its
      commits. A reference into this very repository counts as `#N`; one into
      another repository is reported as foreign-reference and not checked. An
      in-page anchor (`#1-overview`), an HTML entity (`&#39;`) and a file
      fragment (`docs/x.md#12`) are no references. A number that is a pull
      request or no issue at all is reported as skipped; an issue that is
      already closed - typically by the PR's own closing keyword - is still
      searched for carrier formulas. GitHub lists at most 250 commits of a
      pull request; references
      in later commits are not read. This is the list for `pr-poll-review`,
      `[MERGE-GATE]`.
    * without -Pr - every open issue with at least one checkbox or Sub-Issue:
      the clean-up run for `state-audit`, step 3. What it finds there was left
      behind.

    Exactly one Result per issue, decided in this order:

    * no-reference     - the open issue carries neither a checkbox nor a
                         Sub-Issue. Reported only, and only under -Pr.
    * open-boxes       - Count unticked checkboxes plus open Sub-Issues of an
                         open issue. A checkbox inside a quote counts, one
                         inside a code fence does not - the reading of
                         get-checklist-items.ps1, which get-audit-worklist.ps1
                         shares.
    * still-carried-by - Location lists `path:line` of every line of the
                         committed tree (HEAD of the repository -Root lies in)
                         where a carrier formula names the issue within the
                         same clause - on that line or across one line break.
                         Formulas: "carried in", "point in", "getragen in",
                         "carrier:", "Traeger" before the number, and "#N ist
                         der (gueltige) Traeger" / "#N is the carrier" after
                         it. The English ones come from carrier.md, section
                         "Carrier Requirement"; the German ones and "carrier:"
                         are their counterparts in the org's German prose (task
                         of #258, REQ-04). A quotation without a formula does
                         not count. Dated snapshots and spec files (audit/,
                         docs/decisions/, docs/handoffs/, docs/tasks/) are no
                         carriers and are not searched, nor carrier.md itself,
                         which quotes the formulas. Also for a closed issue
                         under -Pr, whose boxes are not counted.
    * closed-clean     - only under -Pr: the issue is closed and no carrier
                         formula names it any more. The search ran; a skipped
                         issue would say so as skipped.
    * closable         - neither of the above. Note carries the closing comment,
                         in German: what delivered the last point (the PR under
                         -Pr, otherwise the newest commit whose message names
                         the number, `git log --grep`), that both checks ran,
                         the date and the commit searched.

    Before a closable issue stands a rehang-first entry wherever an applied
    status marker (`[geplant #N]`, Entscheidung 9 of #258) or a TODO / HACK /
    FIXME names it: once closed, those would point at a closed carrier. Which
    markers are applied is taken from `get-audit-worklist.ps1 -SkipIssue`, the
    sibling script in this directory, not decided a second time here.

    Issues are read over the REST API only (`gh api`, --paginate), never
    `gh issue list` or `gh pr view --json`, both GraphQL, which answers 403 in
    a Claude Code session (#257, Entscheidung 8 of #258). Sub-Issues come from
    the same endpoint get-audit-worklist.ps1 reads
    (`repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/sub_issues`), skipped where the issue's
    sub_issues_summary says it has none.

    When `gh` is missing, unauthenticated or blocked, or the repository or its
    markers cannot be searched, the run says SOURCE UNAVAILABLE and exits 1 - an
    empty list would read as "nothing to close". Otherwise it exits 0, whatever
    it found.

    This script is deliberately SELF-CONTAINED - it imports no module, because
    it is mirrored into every consumer via scripts/common/. It calls two
    siblings there: get-audit-worklist.ps1 for the markers and
    get-checklist-items.ps1 for the checkboxes.

.PARAMETER Repo
    owner/name of the repository. Defaults to what `gh` resolves from the git
    remote of -Root.

.PARAMETER Pr
    Number of the pull request whose referenced issues are checked. Without
    it, every open issue with a checklist is checked.

.PARAMETER Root
    A directory inside the repository that is searched for carrier formulas;
    the whole repository it belongs to is searched. Defaults to the repository
    this script sits in.

.PARAMETER Json
    Serialize the entries as JSON instead of printing them.

.INPUTS
    None.

.OUTPUTS
    [pscustomobject] per entry with Source (issue / rehang-first /
    foreign-reference / skipped / unavailable), Issue, Result, Count, Location,
    Title and Note. Result is set on issue entries only.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/common/find-closable-issues.ps1 -Repo ww3d/playbook -Pr 260

    After the merge of PR 260: which of the issues it names can be closed.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/common/find-closable-issues.ps1 -Repo ww3d/playbook -Json

    Every open issue with a checklist, machine-readable - the audit's
    clean-up run.
