.SYNOPSIS
    List the checkboxes of an issue body - the one checkbox reading the issue
    readers in this directory share.

.DESCRIPTION
    get-audit-worklist.ps1 and find-closable-issues.ps1 both count the
    checkboxes of issue bodies. Each used to carry its own pattern, and the two
    disagreed: one counted a checkbox inside a quote and none inside a code
    fence, the other the reverse (ww3d/playbook#258). Both now call this script, so one body
    yields the same boxes in both.

    A checkbox is a GitHub task-list item in any list form (`-`, `*`, `+`,
    `1.`, `1)`) followed by text, also inside a quote (`> - [ ] x`), where
    GitHub renders it as one. A line inside a fenced code block is an example,
    not a checkbox. A fence opens with three or more backticks or tildes, also
    inside a quote, and closes only with the same character, at least as long,
    and with nothing but whitespace behind it - an opening fence may carry an
    info string, a closing one may not (CommonMark). An unclosed fence runs to
    the end of the body.

    This script is deliberately SELF-CONTAINED - it imports no module, because
    it is mirrored into every consumer via scripts/common/.

.PARAMETER Body
    The issue body, Markdown. Empty yields nothing.

.INPUTS
    None.

.OUTPUTS
    [pscustomobject] per checkbox, in body order, with Checked ([bool]) and
    Text (the item text, trimmed).

.EXAMPLE
    @(./scripts/common/get-checklist-items.ps1 -Body $issue.body | Where-Object { -not $_.Checked }).Count

    The number of unticked checkboxes of an issue.
