# PreToolUse hook — point-of-use rule gate. Generic, byte-identical across
# consumers.
#
# AGENTS.md, section "Session Start: Read Before Anything Else", step 3: before
# the FIRST action of a trigger type in a session, the matching rule file under
# .agents/rules/ is read in full.
#
# This hook is what turns that from an expectation into a gate. It maps the tool
# call about to run onto its trigger(s) and blocks while the file was not read.
# Two sources count, either one is enough:
#   1. the read itself - record-rule-read.sh (PostToolUse on Read) leaves a marker
#      file per session, reader and trigger under ${TMPDIR}/claude-rule-gate/;
#      a sub-agent that read the file itself passes, one that did not is
#      refused (its marker carries its agent_id);
#   2. the typed receipt line in the transcript,
#        rule | .agents/rules/pr.md | <blob SHA> | read
#      kept as a second source for harnesses that run no PostToolUse hook.
# The denial names the path and the blob SHA of the file and nothing else - the
# text of the rule never travels through the hook.
#
# Second gate, same hook: a pull-request review post (`gh pr review`, a `gh api` POST to
# the reviews endpoint, the connector's pull_request_review_write) is refused unless
# /pr-poll-review ran for the PR's CURRENT head in this transcript, and the posting agent
# read the skill's gates.md and checks.md in full - see review_gate below.
# The gate does not see a review posted as a GraphQL mutation (`gh api graphql` with
# addPullRequestReview), a `review-head` line the agent printed itself instead of the skill's gate
# step, a command built in a variable, or a script file that posts: it is a guard against the
# honest slip, not against a determined bypass. A `gh pr review` quoted in a heredoc body counts as a post:
# fail-closed, a false block rather than a hidden post, until the gate reads commands with a shell parser.
#
# Fail-open by design, like require-receipt.sh: a missing jq, an unreadable
# transcript, an unparsable payload or an absent rule file all exit 0 (allow).
# The gate enforces only where it can decide with confidence — a wedged session
# is a worse failure than a missed receipt.
#
# A rule file that does not exist in the repository never blocks anything, so a
# repo that has not received the .agents/rules/ mirror yet behaves exactly as
# before.
#
# Cost. The hook is registered with a matcher naming exactly the tools tool_re
# below accepts (a test holds the two equal), so Read, Grep, Glob, a non-GitHub MCP
# tool and the like never start it. Every call it does see still costs a bash start,
# and under Git Bash every process start costs tens of milliseconds, so separate jq
# starts add up per call (issue ww3d/playbook#276). The payload is read with `$(</dev/stdin)`
# (a byte-by-byte `read` costs about 4.5 ms per KB). Hence three steps, each
# paid only when the one before could not decide:
#   1. the raw payload, with bash builtins only — no further process for a call
#      that cannot map to a trigger (a Bash or PowerShell call without gh);
#   2. one jq start that pulls every field at once;
#   3. the transcript, only when a trigger is mapped and its rule file exists,
#      in one grep+jq pass for all of the call's triggers together.
#
# Windows. Claude Code hands file paths and CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR over with
# backslashes and a drive letter (D:\repo\docs\x.md), runs shell commands
# through a PowerShell tool as well as through Bash, and names the claude.ai
# GitHub connector mcp__claude_ai_GitHub_MCP__* instead of mcp__github__*. All
# three are classified like their POSIX / CLI counterparts (issue ww3d/playbook#276).
#
# Stdin:  the PreToolUse event JSON ({ session_id, transcript_path, cwd,
#         tool_name, tool_input, ... }).
# Stdout: only when blocking — hookSpecificOutput with permissionDecision "deny".

# --- step 3: which receipts are in the transcript? ---------------------------
# Sets `receipted` to the newline-framed list of rule paths whose receipt was
# found. Returns 1 when that could not be established (no transcript, grep or
# jq failing), which the caller treats as "every receipt present" - the
# fail-open direction.
#
# Two sources count, additively:
#   - a plain assistant text block (the documented case);
#   - a command the session RAN to print the line: a tool_use whose
#     .input.command carries the receipt line AND whose own tool_result (same
#     tool_use_id, not is_error) shows it too. Text between tool calls can come
#     out of the model as thinking and then never lands in the transcript as
#     text, so an echoed receipt is the dependable way;
#     but a command that merely carries the line as data does not count
#     (issue ww3d/playbook#273) - a `gh pr comment --body "... rule | ..."` about to run
#     would otherwise unlock itself, a refused one would unlock everything
#     after it, and `cat > f <<EOF` would count a file write. Neither of those
#     prints the line back, which is what the result check asks for.
#
# Only what stands after the newest compaction counts. AGENTS.md, section
# "Session Start: Read Before Anything Else", has every point-of-use receipt
# lapse at a compaction; the transcript file runs on through it, so the cut is
# read from the file itself. Claude Code marks a compaction twice, measured on
# Windows transcripts (Claude Code 2.1.281, 25 compactions): a line
# {"type":"system","subtype":"compact_boundary"} that it always writes, and an
# attachment with hookName "SessionStart:compact" that exists only where a
# SessionStart hook ran. Either one cuts. The per-session marker files are

# --- step 4: the review gate --------------------------------------------------
# A review post needs the posting agent to have read the skill's gates.md and checks.md in
# full (read state or receipt line, like a rule file) and `/pr-poll-review` to have run for
# the PR's current head. The skill
# proves it by printing, with a command of its own at its gate step, one line
#
#   review-head | <owner>/<repo>#<number> | <full 40-hex head SHA>
#
# The line counts like a rule receipt: the command ran, was not refused, and its own result
# shows the line; only what stands after the newest compaction. This step reads the lines,
# asks the forge for the PR's head (`gh api`, one call, only here) and compares. A head
# that moved since the skill ran is a review of an older state: refused.
#
# Fail-open where the forge cannot answer (no gh, offline, unknown PR): a line for the named
# PR is then enough, and the call goes through with a systemMessage that says the head was
# not compared. No line at all is refused whatever gh does - that is the case the gate is for.
#
# Cost: a long session's transcript runs to tens of MB, and the hook has 30 s before it fails open. So the scan
# starts at the newest compaction, found once with grep (the quoted key and value stand verbatim only in a real
# line - inside a JSON string every quote is escaped), and only the lines that can matter reach jq: the skill's
# line and a compaction. jq's raw-line read is the slow step (about 5 s for 38 MB on Git Bash). Every step of that
# pipe must succeed (grep may find nothing); a failing one is a read error and fails open, silently, like a missing
# transcript. Whether a release was given before the post is not checked here: it is a rule for the reviewer
# (`.agents/rules/review.md`), not a mechanism (maintainer's decision on ww3d/playbook#359).
